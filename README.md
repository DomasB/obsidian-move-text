# Obsidian Move text plugin

Simple plugin to replicate VS Code functionality for moving line or selection using keyboard shortcuts.

Default shortcuts are Alt + ArrowUp and Alt + ArrowDown, but they can be remaped in settings.

## Todo
- [] Keep selection and cursor position the same after move (now selection expands to whole lines and cursor is moved at the start of the first moved line)
